# Tetrys

- Disclaimer: This code is old. I made it way back when i was pretty much a beginner. Some parts of the game are inspired by @meth-meth-method's tetris game video. The most striking similarity is probably the color palette, and also the rotate function (i did not manage to make it myself at the time). Most of the code was made by myself however (not so hard to recognize, since it's pretty bad)
